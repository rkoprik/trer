### Motivation

Do firms voluntarily disclose private information (e.g., about earnings, production, future demand, etc.)?

- Yes – why?

To avoid adverse selection!

- Market power leads to information asymmetry – one party has more information than the other
- Market parties can exploit each other – e.g. a firm that doesn’t disclose results has better information about the company value than other agents
- However, people with capital are usually not willing to give money for something unknown
- Keeping information private would make the firm get less capital as investors will discount their beliefs on the company because they are unsure of the value
- Firms are better off if they disclose – higher capital gives them the incentive to do so


### The model - Unraveling with certain information endowment


- Set of i firms with a value x defined as
  \begin{equation}
  x_i = y_i + \epsilon
  \end{equation}
- Where $y_i$ represents the information the firm has and $\epsilon$ has expectation $E[\epsilon]=0$
- Disclosing $y_i$ is costless
- Disclosures are always truthful
- Investors have rational expectations: based on the information they receive, they will price the firm
  \begin{equation}
  P(y) = E[x|y] = y
  \end{equation}
  - They price the firm at y upon disclosure and at y_hat upon nondisclosure
  - The distribution of y is common knowledge

### The assumptions - Unraveling with certain information endowment
- A very strong assumption of our model is perfect information
  - What happens when the manager doesn’t have the information? 
  - Would unraveling still occur?

Is it even realistic to think that a manager wouldn’t have the information on the company?

### The assumptions - Unraveling with uncertain information endowment

- How can the manager be unaware of crucial information on the firm?
  - Unpredictable cases (e.g., Covid-19)
    - Unexpected shock in future demand that affects all firms
  - Different business models (BM)
    - Firms with traditional BM’s know their demand, can compare/estimate based on peers, etc.
    - Innovative BM’s that work with new products don’t really know their future demand – they are trying something new and won’t disclose because than it wouldn’t be new anymore
  - Outside factors
    - Substitute/complementary goods can be released at any time by another firm – affecting future demand, e.g

### Innovation is…new!

- With all those announcements and media attention, why hasn’t Tesla’s stock price gone up before 2020?
    - Model 3 has been around since 2016!
- How could the future the demand (or financial forecast) be unknown?
- It is hard to forecast the impact of innovation!
- Firms themselves can’t know the impact and financial forecast when developing new technologies
    - How do you put a price on something that was never done before?
    - This information is unknown by the manager…
    - …and also by everyone else!
- In this case, the new technology is proving itself profitable after several years when mass production is starting

        \item Once information is known and the market/innovation is already around for some time, it is then possible to quantify and forecast its impacts
        \item Unraveling will occur normally
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Signaling increased future demand by raising price
            \item Market will price Tesla accordingly – increase in the stock price

### In the Musk wave…

- Another example, yet extreme, would be SpaceX.
- Ready for a SpaceX IPO?
  - Company denied any intent to do so, but let’s assume it would.
  - Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas VERY PRECISE valuation is…


“For this report, we built a hypothetical DCF range for SpaceX, valuing the company somewhere between ~$5 bn and $120 bn+, with a Base Case of ~$50 bn.”

### In the Musk wave…

* Part of this depends on whether SpaceX actually does reinvent itself into a satellite-internet company, as Morgan Stanley predicts. (The $5bn figure is their ballparkvaluation if it doesn’t.)

* Mars missions don’t appear to factor into their model.
